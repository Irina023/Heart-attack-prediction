Cardiovascular diseases stay the leading cause of death globally. Early detection of the symptoms is important to prevent the disease 
from fully developing and reduce premature mortality. Classic heart attacks are characterised by severe chest pain and pressure, 
pain in the arm, neck or jaw. But nearly half of heart attacks are described as "silent": they lack most typical symptoms or have symptoms
that you don't recognize as a sign of a heart disease. Silent heart attacks are more common among women and descibed by such symptoms 
as shortness of breath, fatigue and nausea.

This dataset contains factors that affect target variable – Heart Disease (HD).

Age

Sex (male – 1, female – 0)

Trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm/Hg on admission to the hospital)

Chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

Cp – Type of Chest Pain:

– Value 0: asymptomatic

– Value 1: atypical angina

– Value 2: non-anginal pain

– Value 3: typical angina

Fbs: fasting blood sugar (< 120 mg/dl – 0, > 120 mg/dl – 1)

Restecg: resting electrocardiographic results:

– Value 0: normal

– Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

– Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

Thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

Exang: exercise induced angina (yes – 1, no – 0)

Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment:

– Value 0: downsloping

– Value 1: upsloping

– Value 2: flat

Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

Thal (Thalassemia):

– Value 0: NULL

– Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)

– Value 2: normal blood flow

– Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

HD – heart disease (yes – 1, no – 0)
